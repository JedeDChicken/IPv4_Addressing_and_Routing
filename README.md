# CoE197R Exercise

*This exercise involves two parts- an ideal/simulated part via Graphical Network Simulation 3 (GNS3) and hardware/practical part. First, an IP addressing plan was constructed from a given address by partitioning the address space into four /22 blocks then further decomposed into two /24 subnets, a /24 reserve, a /25 network for servers, and 32 /30 networks for point-to-point (P2P) links. The network was then set up with various configurations, and test pings were done to verify correct hosts, switches, routers (gateways and interfaces) configurations, as well as to check if a host could communicate with another host on another subnet. These were then reperformed using physical computers, routers, and cables.

Other skills that were exercised are setting up an Ubuntu Virtual Machine (VM), a Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP (LAMP) stack, and a Virtual Private Network (VPN) with OpenVPN to remotely do the activity outside the laboratory. We also experienced crimping an ethernet cable using the EIA/TIA 568B standard.
